# Rummikub Project

## Commits
When committing changes make sure to comment them well! Be precise and concise.

## Branch rules
- The master branch is protected, and will require pull requests every time before merging. I made it so that two people 
need to review the code. So remember to **branch out whenever you are working on a task!**
- Whenever you submit a PR, also modify the issue board on GitLab, that way peeps can see what is the status on both platforms.

## General remarks
- Whenever you are working on a task, try to comment everything right away (JavaDoc style)
> This thing /**
>             *
>             **/
, that way we can generate the JavaDoc right away later on.
